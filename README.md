# LLM DCAT Generator

**Interactive Generation of DCAT Metadata with LLMs**  

This repository contains a prototype interface for the automatic generation of DCAT metadata using Large Language Models (LLMs).  
The interface was developed as part of a **Bachelor thesis on automatic metadata generation at Hochschule Merseburg**.

## ‚ú® Features

### üîé Dataset Selection
- Users can **select existing datasets** (with title and URL) that **lack a description**.  
- Datasets can be:
  - Uploaded as a list, or  
  - Entered manually.

### ‚öôÔ∏è LLM Configuration
![Configuration Screen](img/configuration.gif)

- Configure **generation parameters**:
  - **Temperature** (creativity vs. determinism).  
  - **Presence and frequency penalties** (to reduce repetition).  
- Adapt the **prompt** to guide the LLM.  
- Configure a **SPARQL query** to retrieve *few-shot examples* (title + description) from a DCAT metadata catalog endpoint (currently: [GovData](https://www.govdata.de/)).  
- The LLM uses these examples together with the dataset title to generate a **plausible dataset description**.

### üìù Metadata Generation & Export
![Generation Screen](img/generation-export.gif)
- Generate:
  - **Dataset description**  
  - **DCAT keywords**  
- Export results as a **DCAT snippet**.  
- Future work: API integration for direct publishing into open data portals.
